2. Calculate rolling average and standard deviation
3. Update baseline table with new statistics
4. Handle edge cases (insufficient data, first-time components)

1. Go service serializes data to JSON
2. Python subprocess launched with timeout
3. Advanced analysis performed (trend detection, anomaly scoring)
4. Results returned via JSON to Go service
5. Enhanced insights included in PR comments
